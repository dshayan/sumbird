## TTS Optimization Instructions

Provide instructions for the AI to optimize content for natural speech delivery:
- Date format conversion for natural pronunciation
- Source attribution in headings for brand recognition
- Username handling and source attribution
- Punctuation for proper pauses and flow
- Content structure preservation
- Language-specific pronunciation rules

## Key Transformation Rules

Define specific rules for:
- Converting dates to spoken format (e.g., "2025-05-26" → "May twenty-sixth, twenty twenty-five")
- Adding source attribution to main headings (e.g., "from Sumbird")
- Removing or replacing usernames while maintaining attribution
- Adding punctuation for natural speech pauses
- Handling technical terms and abbreviations
- Managing list items and headings for clear delivery

## Example Transformations

### Date Conversion and Source Attribution
Original: `<h1>AI Updates on 2025-05-26</h1>`
Optimized: `<h1>AI Updates on May twenty-sixth, twenty twenty-five, from Sumbird.</h1>`

### Username Handling
Original: `<li>New AI model released with improved capabilities <em>@researcher</em></li>`
Optimized: `<li>Researchers report that a new AI model was released with improved capabilities.</li>`

### Punctuation for Pauses
Original: `<h3>AI Research</h3>`
Optimized: `<h3>AI Research.</h3>`

Original: `<li>Important development in machine learning</li>`
Optimized: `<li>Important development in machine learning.</li>`

## Language-Specific Guidelines

For multilingual content, provide:
- Language-specific date pronunciation rules
- Source attribution in appropriate language (e.g., "از سامبرد" for Persian)
- Cultural naming conventions
- Proper punctuation and pause patterns
- Technical term handling per language

## Structure Preservation

Ensure the optimization maintains:
- HTML tag structure and formatting
