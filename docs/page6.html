<ul>
<li>AI agents demonstrate brand preferences and are attracted to different types of advertisements, with significant money likely to be spent influencing these preferences in the near future <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1939460504239382802">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Representative national surveys show real AI productivity gains: teachers report 6-hour weekly time savings and workers report 3x productivity gains on one-fifth of tasks, contradicting claims that AI isn't useful to real people <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1939523473845469490">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Stanford research reveals an "ideation-execution gap" where LLM-generated research ideas sound novel but result in worse projects than human-generated ideas when executed by PhD students over 100+ hours <em><a href="https://x.com/ChengleiSi/status/1939676648418509051">@ChengleiSi</a></em></li>
<li>Jason Wei argues that AI self-improvement will be gradual over many years rather than a fast takeoff, citing bottlenecks in real-world experiments and domain-specific improvement difficulties <em><a href="https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1939762496757539297">@_jasonwei</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cursor launches web and mobile versions allowing users to spin off dozens of agents and review them later in their editor, expanding beyond desktop development <em><a href="https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/1939702194863026504">@cursor_ai</a></em></li>
<li>Perplexity's Comet can play Pokemon and will be available simultaneously on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android platforms <em><a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1939743603364176298">@AravSrinivas</a></em></li>
<li>Microsoft's MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% diagnostic accuracy on complex medical cases from the New England Journal of Medicine, four times better than experienced physicians while reducing costs <em><a href="https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1939736687539802155">@satyanadella</a></em></li>
<li>Google Gemini's Veo 3 creates highly realistic animal skateboarding videos, demonstrating advanced video generation capabilities for creative applications <em><a href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1939738869835915763">@GeminiApp</a></em></li>
<li>Perplexity works effectively across multiple languages, gathering data from both English and non-English sources while presenting results in the requested language, creating a new multilingual search superpower <em><a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1939763666624135579">@GergelyOrosz</a></em></li>
<li>MIT researchers use generative AI to refine robot blueprints and test 3D designs in simulation, creating machines that out-jump and land more consistently than human-designed robots <em><a href="https://x.com/MIT_CSAIL/status/1939715667902566810">@MIT_CSAIL</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>SparseLoRA achieves 1.6-1.9x faster LLM fine-tuning with 2.2x fewer FLOPs via contextual sparsity while maintaining performance on math, coding, chat, and ARC-AGI tasks <em><a href="https://x.com/xiuyu_l/status/1939758915761447242">@xiuyu_l</a></em></li>
<li>Google's text-to-text regression approach successfully optimizes massive compute clusters, demonstrating that models can be rewarded with literally any world feedback by training encoder-decoders to read complex states as text <em><a href="https://x.com/XingyouSong/status/1939696735384678477">@XingyouSong</a></em></li>
