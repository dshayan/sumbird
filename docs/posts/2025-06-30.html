<li>Representative national surveys show real AI productivity gains: teachers report 6-hour weekly time savings and workers report 3x productivity gains on one-fifth of tasks, contradicting claims that AI isn't useful to real people <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1939523473845469490">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Stanford research reveals an "ideation-execution gap" where LLM-generated research ideas sound novel but result in worse projects than human-generated ideas when executed by PhD students over 100+ hours <em><a href="https://x.com/ChengleiSi/status/1939676648418509051">@ChengleiSi</a></em></li>
<li>Jason Wei argues that AI self-improvement will be gradual over many years rather than a fast takeoff, citing bottlenecks in real-world experiments and domain-specific improvement difficulties <em><a href="https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1939762496757539297">@_jasonwei</a></em></li>
