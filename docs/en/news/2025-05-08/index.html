                    <h3>AI Model Announcements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alibaba introduces <b>Qwen3</b> family of eight open large language models, including two mixture-of-experts (MoE) models and six dense models ranging from 32B to 0.6B parameters, supporting reasoning mode and 119 languages <em>@DeepLearningAI</em></li>
<li>Meta introduces <b>Meta Locate 3D</b>, a model for accurate object localization in 3D environments to help robots understand surroundings and interact with humans <em>@AIatMeta</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research shows <b>GPT-4o</b> makes up citations to papers, with bias towards shorter titles and famous papers, though error rates appear lower for Deep Research models <em>@emollick</em></li>
<li>Base language models outperform aligned models at randomness and creativity, suggesting alignment doesn't only extract abilities hidden in pretraining but also hides other abilities <em>@stanfordnlp</em></li>
<li>Google DeepMind's AI <b>co-scientist</b> validated for liver fibrosis research, successfully identifying HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat as having significant anti-fibrotic effects in human liver organoid models <em>@demishassabis</em></li>

</ul>
<h3>AI Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Gemini 2.5</b> can comprehend video content, allowing users to record app explanations, upload to YouTube, and prompt "Build me this" for AI to understand and recreate the application <em>@deedydas</em> <em>@sundarpichai</em></li>
<li>ChatGPT's deep research tool now connects to GitHub repositories, allowing users to ask questions about code while the agent reads and searches source code and PRs <em>@OpenAI</em></li>
<li>Meta and NVIDIA integrate NVIDIA <b>cuVS</b> into Faiss v1.10 for vector search on GPUs, boosting build times by up to 4.7x and reducing search latency by up to 8.1x <em>@AIatMeta</em></li>
<li>Replit launches Notion integration allowing users to connect Notion databases to create customer support pages with AI chatbots trained on support docs <em>@amasad</em></li>
<li>Google launches implicit caching in the <b>Gemini API</b>, enabling 75% cost savings when requests hit cache, with lowered minimum token requirements <em>@LoganKilpatrick</em> <em>@sundarpichai</em></li>
<li>Microsoft integrates <b>Copilot</b> into GroupMe chat app, bringing GPT-4o image generation capabilities directly into group conversations <em>@mustafasuleyman</em></li>
<li>Wells Fargo implemented Microsoft Teams Agent for 35,000 bankers across 4,000 branches, cutting response times for internal questions from 10 minutes to 30 seconds <em>@Microsoft</em></li>
