<li>Truncated Importance Sampling (TIS) in reinforcement learning addresses the mismatch between sampler engines (vLLM/SGLang) and learner engines (FSDP/DeepSpeed) by scaling policy gradients with capped importance ratios. While TIS may show lower logged rewards during training (an artifact from the sampler engine), it improves final model performance by correcting for engine mismatch. Analysis shows distribution strategy differences and sequence length significantly impact mismatch, while inference backend choice has minimal impact <em><a href="https://x.com/cwolferesearch/status/2006210963440087103">@cwolferesearch</a></em></li>
<li><b>GLM-4.7</b> achieves 1224 ELO on GDPval-AA leaderboard, becoming the new open weights leader with a 170-point increase compared to <b>GLM-4.6</b>, meaning outputs from <b>GLM-4.7</b> are expected to beat <b>GLM-4.6</b> 73% of the time in head-to-head comparisons <em><a href="https://x.com/xeophon/status/2006263223880675446">@xeophon</a></em></li>
<li>LG's <b>K-EXAONE</b> features fine-grained MoE design optimized with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), enabling self-speculative decoding that boosts inference throughput by approximately 1.5x <em><a href="https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/2006369448551141506">@ClementDelangue</a></em></li>
<li>Fields medalist Terry Tao discusses the future of mathematics with formal proof systems, stating "I got convinced that this was the future of mathematics... It's a different style of writing proofs that actually is in some ways easier to read—harder to check by humans, but you see more clearly the inputs and outputs of a proof, which traditional writing often conceals... I think the definition of a mathematician will broaden" <em><a href="https://x.com/mathematics_inc/status/2006117894305005762">@mathematics_inc</a></em></li>
