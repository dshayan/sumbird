<li>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang claims the company checks in more <b>open-source AI models and datasets</b> than anyone except AI2, positioning NVIDIA as a major contributor to open AI development <em><a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1972100698025431457">@natolambert</a></em></li>
<li>Every researcher on the Google <b>Veo 3</b> paper, described as the world's best video generation model, is not from the USA, highlighting global talent distribution in AI research <em><a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1972131440902205887">@deedydas</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ethan Mollick demonstrated using <b>ChatGPT Codex</b> to recreate a lost Maxis simulation game (SimRefinery) from just an article and screenshot, building a playable prototype without touching any code directly <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1972043547550666796">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li><b>Claude Code</b> successfully debugged a complex macOS Finder issue that grew to 8GB in size through ~10 iterations over 30 minutes, demonstrating new debugging capabilities that didn't exist before AI agents <em><a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1972038787288154296">@GergelyOrosz</a></em></li>
<li>Scott Aaronson published his first paper where a key technical step in the proof came from AI, specifically using <b>GPT-5-Thinking</b>, describing the AI's contribution as "clever" by academic standards <em><a href="https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/1972378470144679967">@AndrewCurran_</a></em></li>
<li>AI models can now solve most common <b>CAPTCHAs</b> better than humans, with the main reason CAPTCHAs still work being that major LLMs often refuse to complete them rather than lacking capability <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1972177860086612283">@emollick</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>DeepMind's new paper "Video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners" demonstrates that <b>generative video models</b> are to vision problems what LLMs were to NLP problems - single models capable of solving a wide array of challenges <em><a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1972095665921839150">@simonw</a></em></li>
<li>The progression from "agents are nowhere close to working" to "general purpose agents are actually useful for a range of tasks" has occurred in <b>less than a year</b>, with significant improvements in tool use, work steps, and error reduction <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1972141975458796020">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li><b>RL research is becoming like pretraining/modeling</b> with a huge vibe shift, as most published RL research hasn't been using enough compute to make decisions matter as much, though this is slowly changing <em><a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1972323625207509321">@natolambert</a></em></li>
<li>Anthropic researchers predict crossing <b>parity with human experts</b> within "probably only a few months," with the company having stated in 2023 that 2025/26 models could automate large portions of the economy <em><a href="https://x.com/AndrewCurran_/status/1972314032989413517">@AndrewCurran_</a></em></li>
