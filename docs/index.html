<li>TechCrunch reports that writers aren't getting the Anthropic settlement because their work was fed to AI, but because Anthropic illegally downloaded books instead of buying them <em><a href="https://x.com/TechCrunch/status/1964071553424834780">@TechCrunch</a></em></li>
<li>OpenAI announces expansion to Greece, including access to high-quality AI tools in secondary education, plus new OpenAI Certifications and Jobs Platform to help people learn AI skills and businesses find AI-skilled workers <em><a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1964412489518764464">@gdb</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Ethics &amp; Society</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simon Willison argues the $1.5 billion Anthropic books settlement counts as a win for Anthropic, noting it appears legal in the USA to buy used books, scan them, and train on the content under "fair use" transformation <em><a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1964205442554282389">@simonw</a></em></li>
<li>Mathematicians studying whether <b>GPT-5</b> could create original mathematics warn that "the danger is not only loss of originality, but also weakening the very process of being a mathematician" <em><a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1964380959069065389">@deedydas</a></em></li>

</ul>
<h3>AI Applications</h3>

<li>Simon Willison extensively tests <b>GPT-5 Thinking</b> with Bing search, calling it his "Research Goblin" and noting that after nearly three years of advising against using ChatGPT for search, <b>GPT-5</b> with Bing is now "a spectacularly useful search engine" <em><a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1964413597507080439">@simonw</a></em></li>

</ul>
<h3>AI Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI research suggests hallucinations are less a problem with LLMs themselves and more an issue with training on tests that only reward right answers, encouraging guessing rather than saying "I don't know" <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1964347733499638063">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Ethan Mollick theorizes that OpenAI releasing <b>o1-preview</b> was strategically questionable since showing off reasoning allowed everyone to copy it immediately, whereas holding off until <b>o3</b> and calling that <b>GPT-5</b> would have been a more startling leap <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1964373393983361074">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Nathan Lambert reports being bullish that <b>GPT-5 Pro</b> or <b>Gemini Deep Think</b> are the smartest models available publicly today, recommending people use one or both <em><a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1964383896612835649">@natolambert</a></em></li>
<li>Eugene Yan advocates for evaluation-driven development (EDD) analogous to test-driven development, emphasizing that generic evals like "faithfulness" and "helpfulness" aren't useful - evals must be aligned with specific user problems <em><a href="https://x.com/eugeneyan/status/1964334356006391882">@eugeneyan</a></em></li>
