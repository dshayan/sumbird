<li>METR research shows continued exponential progress in AI capabilities for sustained work with no unexpected leaps but also no walls, according to their latest benchmark measurements <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1954180531785994670">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Nathan Lambert explains that RL scaling differs fundamentally from pretraining because "with RL, you can pull your checkpoints out" while pretraining can't just "take where you are now" <em><a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1954181436849651782">@natolambert</a></em></li>
<li>Nathan Lambert argues that scaling training clusters 10x may no longer be financially worth it, but this doesn't invalidate the bitter lesson, which points to ideas that pay off more effectively with current scaled compute <em><a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1954260535186542810">@natolambert</a></em></li>
