<li>Gemini leads GenAI tools with over 3x the month-over-month growth rate of runner-up Perplexity, while Grok shows negative growth and DeepSeek sees first positive growth since February <em><a href="https://x.com/Similarweb/status/1977297941099434289">@Similarweb</a></em></li>
<li>Enterprise AI adoption faces significant rate-limiting factors including human and organizational ability to absorb change, regulations, and enterprise budgets, beyond just infrastructure and algorithmic breakthroughs <em><a href="https://x.com/sriramk/status/1977424467627299126">@sriramk</a></em></li>

<h3>AI Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Emerging <b>"deep AI use"</b> cases where experts have automated complex, valuable tasks in their domains, though diffusion of specific use cases will be slower than general AI adoption <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1977415102606577684">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Claude Code can be prompted to <b>"use sub-agents"</b> to fire up multiple parallel sub-agents for complex tasks, each with fresh context <em><a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1977124799454626004">@simonw</a></em></li>
<li>Current AI feels capable enough for most tasks lasting up to a few minutes, with failures often due to insufficient background context rather than capability limitations <em><a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1977425127534166521">@gdb</a></em></li>
<li>Sam Altman predicts <b>Codex</b> will dramatically transform software creation, making it difficult to imagine what software development will look like by the end of 2026 <em><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1977177505971736675">@sama</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>LLMs now dominate hard STEM contests including the International Math Olympiad, International Olympiad on Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, and International Informatics Olympiad, despite being poor at math just a year ago <em><a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1977460160197956089">@emollick</a></em></li>
<li>Industry analysis suggests <b>OpenAI</b> has the best post-training/reinforcement learning capabilities applied to weaker pretraining, while <b>Gemini</b> has spectacular pretraining that made creating reasoning models surprisingly easy <em><a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1977455816312557990">@natolambert</a></em></li>
<li>Top 5 most impactful open AI models ranked: <b>DeepSeek R1</b> (ignited Chinese open model ecosystem), <b>LLaMA</b> (enabled post-ChatGPT RLHF research), <b>Mistral 7B</b> (created community interest in finetuning), <b>LLaMA 3.1</b> (closest open models to frontier), and <b>Qwen 3</b> (summarizes Qwen's current R&amp;D dominance) <em><a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1977385568293269511">@natolambert</a></em></li>
